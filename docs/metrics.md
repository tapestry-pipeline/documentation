Your Tapestry dashboard contains documentation for how to use Tapestry, along with various pages for each section of your pipeline: Data Ingestion, Data Storage & Data Transformation, and Data Syncing). Each page displays metrics that give you better insight into the health of each component, such as CPU utilization and instance health. They also include links to the UIs of all of the tools being used at each stage of the pipeline: Airbyte, Grouparoo, Snowflake, and DBT.
